//! sensus-core — sensory perception simulation core.
//!
//! Pure logic library that applies sensory filters (color blindness, blur,
//! visual field defects, hearing loss, etc.) to media buffers. All public
//! entry points take and return [`image::DynamicImage`] so callers can chain
//! filters without committing to a specific pixel format.
//!
//! This crate intentionally has **no I/O** — file reads, file writes,
//! decoding from arbitrary formats, and any subprocess work belongs in the
//! `sensus` CLI crate or in downstream applications (e.g. universal-experience).
